        "description-LAN-ACL": "Routers and PCs were configured by assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. The OSPF protocol 15 was enabled on routers for dynamic routing management. Additionally, both standard and extended ACLs were implemented to control communication in the network: one blocks the network 166.16.166.0 to subnet 20.30.40.0, another prevents Laptop 4 from communicating with area 1, a third one prevents communication between Laptop 18 and Laptop 16, one more blocks traffic from subnet 10.20.30.0 to subnet 80.80.1.0, and the last one prevents communication between Laptop 5 and Laptop 6. These ACLs were applied on the respective output interface on the router to regulate traffic and ensure network security."
